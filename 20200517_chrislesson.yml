        - summary: |
        Erica Bauermeister, the national bestselling author of The School of Essential Ingredients, 
        presents a moving and evocative coming-of-age novel about childhood stories, families lost and 
        found, and how a fragrance conjures memories capable of shaping the course of our lives.

        Emmeline lives an enchanted childhood on a remote island with her father, who teaches her about the 
        natural world through her senses. What he wonâ€™t explain are the mysterious scents stored in the drawers 
        that line the walls of their cabin, or the origin of the machine that creates them. As Emmeline grows, 
        however, so too does her curiosity, until one day the unforeseen happens, and Emmeline is vaulted out 
        into the real world--a place of love, betrayal, ambition, and revenge. To understand her past, Emmeline 
        must unlock the clues to her identity, a quest that challenges the limits of her heart and imagination.

        Lyrical and immersive, The Scent Keeper explores the provocative beauty of scent, the way it can reveal 
        hidden truths, lead us to the person we seek, and even help us find our way back home.
